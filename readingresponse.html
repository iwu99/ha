  <h2>What is code?</h2>
  <p>
Coding is an alignized language. Programmer might not know why the code is this way but they can use it as a tool. While we are using the electronic devices, because we are so used to it so we forgot to understand why it works this way and it also has limitation.<br>
They are just a computing machine that calculate much faster than human. That makes there is no mistake or curve in coding which means every character matters. While doing design, this way of thinking can also be used, because every detail matters.

<h2>  What screens want?</h2>
<p>
  The screen is getting smaller and smaller. What is the suitable size for human? And every function is getting merged together: Calculator, clock, cat videos all can be seen in one device. Screen also like this way. It used to be only output, the screen now is usually both input and output. The trend of our design is also trying to fit this trend.
  <br>The system we are using is just a bunch of metaphors which improves user experience.
  In this article, I find the last part of it very interesting. The author talks about the map’s stereotype. Certain arrangement of the content may misinform and confuse the users with different needs. Whost webs are like maps , they are not for me so things are distorted. Those websites, the apps are made for us but they are probably not suitable for us. Sometime even becomes a pressure to the audiences.
</p>
<h2>  Capitalism vs. Privacy</h2>
<p>  Capitalism emphasis on everyone’s right on privacy. But protect privacy of custumers contradict the profit making trend in capitalism. That’s because personality becomes a advertising way of products.<br>
  This article reminds people a thing that design cannot separate from the politics. Same thing can be used to count number of bread and also can be used by Nazi to count population. Our pay for using more convenient technology is losing our privacy. However, what capitalism informs people is that not sharing is a barrier to development.
  <p>
  <h2>Critical Atlas of Internet</h2>
  <p>Questions that if Internet is a place without barrier just like universe or it is a container of users. And that is fascinating because in here everything finally merged together. The distance does not matter. But there is still many ways to regulate what people inside by outside power. <br>The linear models in this article is very interesting, it gives internet a solid body and refer to it as a different world that create by human beings.  Just like we are in this world, our physical position decides what we see. Moreover, there cannot be internet without physical presence. </p>

  <h2>New Clues</h2>
  <p>This articles focus on the audience in the internet.  Without audience, this system does not exist. We own the internet. We download, post our messages to the pool and other did the same. We are sunk into a huge force of internet. Everyone’s message might be a recreation of other’s words because there is no distance between people.<br>
  Also because we are “anonymous” in the internet. People tends to say mean thing in that, it is a world that people does not care about their pride. If it’s in the real world, there might be tons of bleeding events. Also, internet is a accelerating world,  details of people can be quote to simple tags, it may shorten people’s distance? In addition, net increases the speed of become popular and allows people to get to know everything much faster.
